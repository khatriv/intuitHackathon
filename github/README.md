Our idea is to help employees and employers manage the daily tasks efficiently. We have developed two systems for the purpose:

1. Web App   ---    This will be used by the employer to assign, view and update tasks to the employees.

2. Mobile App  ---  This will be used by the employees to view and update their tasks daily.

‘WorkBuddy’ is a simple yet efficient app that consists of a checklist of the tasks assigned to an employee. The employee can view all his tasks at hand based on priority and can give updates the progress on the same. It will also keep an account of the number of working hours that an employee has worked on per task basis as well as his/her collective contribution.

For an employer, it becomes super easy to keep track of all his employees, their no. of working hours, their tasks assigned and the status. Employer has a web app where he can Add Tasks or view Statistics of his employees (no. of working hours, day-wise, week-wise or month-wise)

A typical workflow is something like this:

Consider a Ladies Boutique with 50 employees. Each employee comes to the store and logins to the app which triggers the start time. He sees the app which gives him a list of tasks:

- Tasks Pending: with their estimated remaining time and priority order 

- Tasks Completed: tasks that have been successfully completed

- Tasks Blocked: task on which an employee is blocked  
He can see the details of the task (requirements, reference images, specs, etc) and start working on it. He can mark a task as ‘complete’ or give ‘updates’ on the task. Any action taken by the employee on the app can be seen by the employer in his web app ('Activity' section). As the employee logs out at the end of the day, the employer is notified about the no. of hours the employee worked during that day.

There are statistics that can be seen by the employee in his app. He can check the no. of hours he worked day-wise, week-wise and month-wise.

The idea can solve the following problems in a simple way:

1. The app keeps a track of no. of hours an employee has worked for. This will be of great help to the employer while billing his employees. 

2. An employer can send notifications if there is an urgent requirement of a particular task. The employee would easily get all the required details of the task. 
3. There is a record of all the tasks being done by the employees. Serves as a log-book.

4. A rating can be given to the employees if they out-perform and/or work over-time. ‘Star’ ratings can be given to the employees (can be seen in the record section of the mobile app). This can be rewarded by paying a bonus as an appreciation.. Helps in retention of the employees.


To run the mobile app - import the gradle to your Android Studio.
For the web app - it's a static assests webapp. Open the file in any browser.
